# CycleGAN_project

This project trains CycleGAN to transfer between human faces and cats/dogs faces and takes human images and convert them to look like cat/dog faces. This is based on the research paper Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks <https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593>.
